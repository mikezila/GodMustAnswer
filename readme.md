# God Must Answer
The tower lay in ruin, yet still you climb?

Such defiance.  What you seek no longer exists.

May heaven grant you wealth.

## What is this?
A fan-made sequel/epilogue to the amazing and inspirational game "Tower of Heaven".  If you haven't played it, please, please do.  Itâ€™s available from many places for free.

## Is this an official project?
No.  I am in no way associated with anyone who worked on or created "Tower of Heaven".  This is 100% a fan work.  I seek no profit from its creation.  I use the sounds and graphics from the original game, but no code from it.

## Why not just use the original game's level editor?
This is as much a love letter to the original game as it is a programming exercise for myself.  The code in *God Must Answer* is 100% original.  I also want to tell a separate story, which is something using custom levels in the original game won't accomplish well.

## How did you make this?
It is written in 100% pure Ruby, using the Gosu gem.  It was made on Windows using Ruby 1.9.3, though I am taking care to do things the "right" way to make running it on Mac or Linux painless.  It only uses .png graphics which should work anywhere, and .ogg sounds which Gosu provides support for itself.  A Windows .exe will be provided when the time comes to make running it easier for Windows users.

## Is it done?
No, not even close.

## What is your goal?
I aim to create at least another 11 levels to match the original game's length, and a level editor.  The level editor is sort of a side-effect, as it was made for me to use to make the game's levels.  Why not include it, though?

## How do I run it?
Right now the code is very much in flux, so it's unlikely to do anything in it's current state for you.  Though when it's ready all you'll need to do is run main.rb with Ruby.  The only requirement is the Gosu gem.  If you don't have it, just do...

    gem install gosu

...and it'll be installed for you.  This can get a little hairy depending on what platform you're on.  On Windows you must use Ruby 1.9.3, as Gosu's support for Ruby 2.0 doesn't work on Windows yet.

It's very unlikely that you'll see any benefit to running it right now if you don't already know how to run Ruby anyway.  Just wait and once it's ready an .exe will be provided.
